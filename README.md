 Limitations
Only supports English voice input for now.

Restaurant data is hardcoded and not fetched from an API or external source.

Does not handle follow-up questions like "cheaper options near Bandra."

No LLM or API integration yet.



Note: Can integrate LLM because of its cost of Key I tried to Integrate LLM but it always said quota out of limit
